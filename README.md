Rectification module from e-foto photogrammetry suit (more info on the official website: http://www.efoto.eng.uerj.br/en). The module seems to be abandoned, but it is very useful for 2d archaeological photomapping through the "Metodo Aramus". E-foto software has been developed since 2004 by the Photogrammetry Lab of the Rio de Janeiro State University’s School of Engineering and released under the GNU General Public License (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
